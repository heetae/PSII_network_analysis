# General notes
This repository hosts python code to compute network effect of the excitation energy transfer of PSII SC.
The analysis is based on the FÃ¶rster resonance energy transfer rate between chlorophylls.

# Requirements
numpy and pandas

# Usage
A user should have all seven data files prepared before running `main.py`.
Excuting `main.py` by python in console will automatically load the data file and generate the time series excitation energy trace as Pandas dataframe.
```bash
python main.py
```
